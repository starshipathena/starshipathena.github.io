									<span>History</span>
								</div>
								<p>With the Andromeda-class the Starfleet Corps of Engineers meant to duplicate the success of the earlier Pathfinder-class update to the Intrepid-class hull plan. Designed and built at Utopia Planitia Fleet Yards, the Andromeda-class featured improved capabilities over even retrofitted Galaxy-class vessels.</p>

								<img class="pics border" src="/images/AthenaShip.jpg">

								<p>Ship design occurred under the Andromeda Class Development Project moniker in 2409. Its layout and systems resulted from compromises between the traditionalist, pragmatist, and progressivist factions within the Advanced Starship Design Bureau. The traditionalist camp argued for always having a multi-role exploration cruiser, including for sentimental value. The pragmatists and progressivists were convinced by building the USS Andromeda technologically advanced and wartime-ready.</p>
								
								<p>The Andromeda exploration cruiser was earmarked for Operation Delta Rising, the project to expand the Khitomer Alliance into the Delta Quadrant in 2410.</p>
								
								<p>The systems updates developed for the Andromeda-class were later reused in the Yamato-class dreadnought cruiser, a variant of the Galaxy X-class.</p>
								
								<p>The design aesthetic, including deflector dish assembly and warp nacelles, were replicated on ships of other classes.</p>
								
								<p>As of 2411, the Andromeda-class remained the newest iteration of the Galaxy-class series of exploration cruisers.</p>

								<p>Assignment to a Andromeda-class ship is something highly sought by ambitious officers, as it is only granted to the absolute best in every area. While their missions might be shorter, these ships are sent to areas which Starfleet is interested in examining quickly and effectively with little external support, so they have to be prepared for anything. As such, this leads to a sense among Andromeda crews that they are elite units, leading to both positive displays of comradeship as well as sometimes exclusionary and cliquish practices which make it difficult for new crewmembers to integrate, especially if a crew has already been deployed in the field.</p>
									
								<p>Recreational facilities aboard a Andromeda are quite comprehensive, having quite the luxury like of a Galaxy or Odyssey-class ship. Holodecks, holosuites, and recreational lounges are plentiful and most crew members have their own quarters.</p>
									
								<p>Divsion head roles aboard this class are often seen as direct stepping stones towards the command track on other explorers, with a tour on one of these ships being enough to catapult many officers up to executive officer positions. On that token, however, these assignments are so popular that crews will often stay together for many years.</p>

									<span>Etymology</span>
								</div>
								<p>The USS Athena is named after the ancient Greek goddess Athena, a revered deity symbolizing wisdom, strategic warfare, and protection. In Greek mythology, Athena was celebrated not only as a goddess of knowledge and strategic prowess but also as a protector of cities and civilizations. This connection to intelligence, careful planning, and defense aligns with Starfleet&apos;s mission to explore the galaxy with a thoughtful, scientific approach while safeguarding Federation citizens and allies. The USS Athena, therefore, embodies Starfleet's commitment to both knowledge and responsible, strategic action in the face of the unknown.</p>

								<p>The name Athena also signifies Starfleet&apos;s preference for peace and diplomacy over aggression, as Athena herself represented disciplined and just warfare. Unlike Ares, the god of chaotic conflict, Athena&apos;s strength was tempered with a preference for resolution and protection. This ideal is reflected in the USS Athena&apos;s role within Starfleet: while equipped with the technology and tactical capability to defend the Federation, the ship and its crew prioritize peaceful exploration, scientific discovery, and diplomatic relations with new civilizations.</p>
									
								<p>Additionally, the USS Athena honors Earth&apos;s cultural heritage by drawing inspiration from one of humanity&apos;s oldest and most respected mythologies. Starfleet&apos;s choice of this name represents a nod to the wisdom of the past, guiding the Federation toward a prosperous future. The USS Athena serves as a vessel of knowledge, protection, and unity, carrying forward Athena&apos;s legacy of intellectual curiosity and principled defense across the stars.</p>
